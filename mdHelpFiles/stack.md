# Stack Viewer Help

The stack viewer allows you to explore slices through the current stack.

To move around the slice either click and drag or use a 3 finger drag gesture (when over the image).

Hovering shows items that can be added by clicking in combination with the shift key.

Clicking on any item displayed in the stack selects it.

Zoom level is controlled by either 2 finger pinch, ctrl + mouse wheel or the <i class="fa fa-search-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> / <i class="fa fa-search-minus" aria-hidden="true"></i> icons.

Stack position is controlled via 2 finger scroll, mouse wheel or the <i class="fa fa-chevron-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> / <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> icons.

<b>Note:</b> Both button and mouse wheel navigation through the stack can be accelerated by pressing the shift key in combination.

The orthogonal orientation of the slice is toggled by the <i class="fa fa-refresh" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon. 

The botton toggle switch controlls the display of the current slice within the 3D window giving your current selection context within the volume';
